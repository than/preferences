A list of personal computing preferences.

⥣ 

## Typography

I enjoy [Source Code Pro](http://adobe-fonts.github.io/source-code-pro/) in my coding environments. [Fira Sans](http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/styleguide/products/firefox-os/typeface/) plays well with my notes in nvALT.

## Apps

### Code

I split time between [Coda](https://panic.com/coda/) and [Sublime Text 3](http://www.sublimetext.com) depending on the project.

### Text

[nvALT](http://brettterpstra.com/projects/nvalt/) is a constant companion for note-taking and brain-dumping.

I enjoy previewing text files and Markdown documents in [Marked](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/marked/id448925439?mt=12&at=10lbaT) with the built-in *Amblin* theme.

Of course, I would be remiss if I did not point out that both of these fine applications are developed by [Brett Terpstra](http://brettterpstra.com).

## Social

### Twitter

Give me Tweetbot or give me death. I use both [Tweetbot for Mac](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/tweetbot-for-twitter/id557168941?mt=12&at=10lbaT) and  [Tweetbot for iOS](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/tweetbot-3-for-twitter-iphone/id722294701?mt=8&uo=4&at=10lbaT)

## Audio

### Music

[Rdio��� [Rdio](http://than.mn/rdio) is my streaming service of choice.

### Podcasts

For now, I've hitched my wagon to Instacast. Both desktop and mobile apps do a reasonable job keeping each other in sync. [Instacast for Mac](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/instacast/id733258666?mt=12&uo=4&at=10lbaT) and [Instacast 4 (iOS)](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/instacast-4-podcast-client/id577056377?mt=8&at=10lbaT).

## Data Security

If you're not using [1Password](https://agilebits.com/onepassword), why aren't you using 1Password. The [1Password iPhone app](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/1password-password-manager/id443987910?mt=12&uo=4&at=10lbaT) is indispensable. 

[Backblaze](http://than.mn/bb) does a fine job of staying out of my way and keeping my data safe. I've only needed to restore something critical twice, and each time Backblaze came through as advertised.
