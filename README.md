## Typography

I enjoy [Source Code Pro](https://sourceforge.net/projects/sourcecodepro.adobe/) in my coding environments. [Fira Sans](http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/styleguide/products/firefox-os/typeface/) plays well with my notes in nvALT.

## Apps

I split time between [Coda](https://panic.com/coda/) and [Sublime Text 3](http://www.sublimetext.com) depending on the project.

[nvALT](http://brettterpstra.com/projects/nvalt/) is a constant companion for note-taking and brain-dumping.

I enjoy previewing text files and Markdown documents in [Marked](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/marked/id448925439?mt=12&at=10lbaT) with the built-in *Amblin* theme.

Of course, I would be remiss if I did not point out that both of these fine applications are developed by [Brett Terpstra](http://brettterpstra.com).
